2.00.00

Upgraded to Python 3.8.2 and OpenSSL 1.1.1e.

Replaced the deprecated `oauth2client` library with the `google-auth` library.
This change requires a one-time update of the client access file `oauth2.txt`; GAM will continue
to use the old version of `oauth2.txt` until you perform the update. There is a small performance
impact until the update is performed. However, you can't use the updated version of `oauth2.txt`

Use an executable version of GAM 5.00.00+ to perform the update.
```
gam oauth refresh
```
